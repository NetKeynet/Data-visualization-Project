          This infographic provides additional insights into the correlation between public art installations and places of interest in various wards of Toronto. It highlights key findings and statistics that complement the data shown on the map.

        <p>
         The design of this infographic makes use of a 3D gallery visualization to effectively present and compare the number of public arts installation vs the places of interest across the tops 5 Toronto wards. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The 3D gallery transforms the data into a tangible and immersive experience by arranging the ward as framed artworks. The central focus of the gallery is Spadina-Fort York which has the highest counts of both public art installation and places of interest drawing immediate attention to it. The other wards are positioned around the main artwork with their data displayed on the wall to allow easy comparison and visual hierarchy forcing the viewer eyes to travel from the most significant piece to the other. To add a sense of scale and relatability, I added human figure which help viewer connect with the data on a personal level emphasizing the human aspect interaction of this data. Each artwork is displayed with its wardâ€™s data clearly labeled with both the percentage of public art and places of interest.
